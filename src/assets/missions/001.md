*FROST: “Excuse me sir, a what?”*
*GORMAN: “A xenomorph.”*
*HICKS (louder): “It’s a bug-hunt.”*

# Goals

- Protect Evergreen engineering teams during deployment to outlying relays.
- Identify and eliminate sniper presence disrupting relay maintenance.
- Investigate abnormal signals and civilian silence near the Châus’ homestead.
- Locate and shut down the source of the hostile broadcast.

# Stakes

- The safety of Evergreen’s frontline engineering personnel.
- Maintaining signal relay integrity for colony-wide comms.
- Preventing psychological warfare from spreading through Evergreen’s networks.
- Understanding the first signs of an intelligence behind local machine aggression.

## Union Colonial Response Log – Evergreen Perimeter

# PROVISIONAL PRIORITY – CLASSIFIED

Operation began with a multi-squad deployment across the southern relay fields. Evergreen engineers encountered sustained fire from a long-range sniper platform of unknown make and origin. Pilots executed a split operation to neutralize the sniper while maintaining a defensive perimeter around the engineering team. Mission success: No civilian casualties, full relay recovery.

Concurrent investigation of signal distortion near the Châu homestead revealed the presence of a powerful psychological broadcast. The farmhouse had been overrun—its occupants presumed dead or forcibly converted.

Broadcast was terminated at the source after a close-quarters engagement with a unit of corrupted subalterns and industrial machinery. Source of signal bore clear technological similarities to Union-era architecture but had been extensively altered.

Initial conclusion: Hostile entity possesses coordination capabilities, strategic foresight, and a clear ideological vector.
