FLOODGATE

# RIPLEY: “No good. We don’t know if it’ll affect them.”

# HUDSON: “Look, let’s just bug out and call it even, okay?”

# RIPLEY: “I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It’s the only way to be sure.”

# BURKE: “Whoah! Hold on a second. This installation has a substantial dollar value attached to it–”

# RIPLEY: “They can bill me. I got a tab running.”

### SITUATION OVERVIEW
Cinder Squad responded to irregular signal patterns emanating from deep within the nearby valleys south of Evergreen. Patience’s behavior had become erratic, marked by periods of silence, memory loss, and fragmented protocol enforcement—symptoms indicative of either corruption or external influence.

Following partial recovery of NHP data and direct contact with REGRET, it became clear that a deeper force—referred to only as “The Machine” and potentially led by an entity named Beggar One—was behind the manipulation of local subalterns, signal transmissions, and rogue synths.

An expedition was organized to trace the signal to its origin and determine the nature of this emergent threat.

### MISSION OBJECTIVES
- Identify and isolate the source of the anomalous signal affecting Patience and regional subalterns.
- Prevent collapse of Patience’s remaining casket containment systems.
- Secure any survivors or functional systems in outlying homesteads and facilities.
- Gain actionable intelligence on “Beggar One” and their Machine faction.

### CRITICAL TASKS
## › MERRICKTOWN EVACUATION
Upon encountering the ruins of Merricktown, Cinder Squad discovered signs of a recent subaltern massacre. Survivors were located and extracted under fire. Subaltern behavior suggests full override by foreign intelligence.

## › THE ROADBLOCK LOSS
During a retreat from the valley toward a pre-planned fall-back zone, Cinder Squad encountered a Machine-occupied checkpoint reinforced with heavy automated defenses. The squad took significant damage and was forced to withdraw, marking the first tactical defeat of the campaign.

## › BEGGAR ONE CONTACT
Amidst signal interference and cascading network instability, the pilots received a direct transmission from Beggar One—an entity cloaked in Machine code and speaking through repurposed subaltern systems. The broadcast included distorted philosophy, veiled threats, and allusions to a greater digital order. Attempts to trace or engage the signal were unsuccessful.

### RESULTS & NOTES
Merricktown effectively razed. Survivors secured but critical infrastructure lost.

First sighting of Beggar One confirmed; capabilities unknown.

Machine forces possess integrated subaltern/human hybrid systems.

Patience remains operational, but is now considered compromised.

### MISSION STATUS
This mission is complete. The enemy is actively adapting, and Union considers the digital battlespace in Hercynia to be compromised. Strategic options are narrowing.

### STAKES
This is no longer a containment operation. With subalterns across the region exhibiting hive-like behavior and corrupted NHP elements spreading influence through both physical and digital vectors, this mission could mark the threshold between manageable insurgency and full-scale digital war. If Beggar One breaches Evergreen’s internal networks, Union presence on Hercynia may become unsustainable.
