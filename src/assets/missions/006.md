### SITUATION OVERVIEW

The time has come.

Hivehome lies in ruin, its people scattered. The Overmind is silent. Daylight is gone. The Egregorians, fractured and reeling, march for Mycol Fields under skies still streaked with orbital ash. Yet even now, there is hope—there is resistance.

Cinder Squad, bloodied but soon to be reunited, have survived the worst the Machine could offer. But the fight is not over. Not while Evergreen remains occupied. Not while it's people and half of them remain in cells. Not while Beggar One lives.

Before them lies a single campaign—divergent paths, culminating in one final stand. To reach that moment, they must strike surgically, decisively: Jailbreak the people of Evergreen. Rescue their comrades. Confront the orbital threat. And, at last, face the Architect of this apocalypse.

Beggar One.

### MISSION OBJECTIVES

- Infiltrate or assault Evergreen to liberate Vet, Vanisher, and Outlaw.
- Disrupt or destroy orbital targeting infrastructure to blunt further planetary strikes.
- Coordinate with HUC forces and subvert Beggar One’s command structure.
- Eliminate Beggar One to end the immediate threat to Hercynia.
- Reclaim Evergreen as a safe haven and rally point.

### CRITICAL TASKS

## › **JAILBREAK**

The Prison is fortified, patrolled by subalterns and defended by elite forces. Cinder Squad must break in and free their captured squadmates—Vet, Vanisher, and Outlaw—before the full counterattack can begin.

## › **HEAVEN’S EYE**

Beggar One’s orbital threat remains active. Before the final engagement, the team may choose to investigate and dismantle the infrastructure enabling planetary strikes.

## › **STAND OF THE FAITHFUL**

The HUC, led now by Terror, pledges support. This includes Ranger squads, remnants of Hivehome’s garrison, and Egregorian warforms. Their aid will shift the tide when the final battle arrives—but it is the players’ actions that will trigger that moment.

## › **BEGGAR’S END**

The final confrontation. Beggar One waits in the heart of Evergreen—commanding armies, shaping history, and preparing for the Machine’s future. The squad must bring everything they have to end him.

### RESULTS & NOTES

* Evergreen remains occupied. Civilian extermination is imminent if the mission fails.
* The HUC has mobilized. Their forces will follow the squad’s lead when the signal is given.
* Cinder Squad is fully reunited once the Jailbreak is completed.
* Ferryman presumed dead.
* The outcome of this mission will determine the fate of Hercynia’s last cities and the legacy of Union intervention.

### MISSION STATUS

**Active.**
This is the final operation. Multiple FULL REPAIRS will be available during the mission. Players may bring any reserves or gear acquired during prior downtime.

### STAKES

If Evergreen falls, the last bastion of resistance collapses. The Machine will begin systematic extermination of the region’s population. All hope of reclaiming Hercynia will be lost.

But if the mission succeeds—Beggar One dead, Evergreen free, orbital threat neutralized—Union will grant the squad full logistical support. Countless lives will be saved. The war will turn.

Pilots will reach License Level 5.
