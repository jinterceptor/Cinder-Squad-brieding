LAST CASTLE

# RIPLEY: “Anything?”

# HUDSON: “There’s something.”

# HUDSON: “It’s inside the complex.”

# VASQUEZ: “You’re just reading me.”

# HUDSON: “No. No! It ain’t you. They’re inside. Inside the perimeter. They’re in here.”

### SITUATION OVERVIEW
Cinder Squad has returned to Evergreen under rapidly deteriorating conditions. Patience, the colony’s NHP administrator, has shown signs of severe instability, withholding access to communications and governance systems, and issuing erratic orders.

Meanwhile, reports flood in from the surrounding Gray Towns—Merricktown and Liu Maize have fallen. Fires rage across the southern tree line. Machine forces—subalterns and corrupted mechs under the influence of the entity known as Beggar One—march steadily toward Evergreen in staggering numbers.

With panic rising and communications collapsing, Evergreen locks down. Civilians are left outside the gates. The Militia fractures under the pressure. Refugees riot. Command is contested. And in the midst of it all, the Machine waits.

### MISSION OBJECTIVES
- Prevent collapse of Evergreen’s defenses.

- Aid the refugees outside Evergreen in any way possible.

- Monitor and assess Beggar One’s tactical behavior and deployment.

### CRITICAL TASKS
## › MERRICKTOWN EVACUATION
Upon encountering the ruins of Merricktown, Cinder Squad discovered signs of a recent subaltern massacre. Survivors were located and extracted under fire. Subaltern behavior suggests full override by foreign intelligence.

## › REFUGEE STANDOFF
Outside Evergreen’s walls, tensions boil over as refugees surge toward the gates, begging for sanctuary. The Militia, under Patience’s directive, denies entry. The pilots convince the militia to stand down, but the flood of incomming refugees quickly destabilises the area, resulting in anarchy and deaths on all sides.

## › FINAL TRANSMISSION
Patience initiates a general colonial assembly, broadcasting a heavily-censored address citywide. Mid-transmission, Evergreen is rocked by a seismic event: Beggar One has deployed an orbital weapon, vaporizing the mountaintop North of the colony. The blast levels the underground city of Daylight and triggers ongoing tremors, plunging Evergreen into darkness.

### RESULTS & NOTES
Merricktown and Liu Maize destroyed.

Subalterns display coordinated behavior under Beggar One's command.

Patience now considered fully compromised.

Refugee crisis creates irreversible political fracture inside Evergreen.

Enemy forces too numerous to repel. Defending Evergreen is no longer a viable strategy.

### MISSION STATUS
This mission is ongoing, but Evergreen is lost in all but name. Any remaining hope lies in evacuation, sabotage, or subversion of Beggar One’s command structure. The longer the squad remains, the narrower the odds.

### STAKES
If Evergreen falls, Landmark Colonial loses its final stable colony in the southern hemisphere. With Patience compromised, NHP security protocols have failed. The threat posed by Beggar One is no longer theoretical—it is real, it is coordinated, and it has orbital support. Unless checked soon, Beggar One’s forces may secure a strategic foothold capable of contesting Hercynia at planetary scale.
