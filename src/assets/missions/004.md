Mission // 004 - A
LAST CASTLE

# RIPLEY: “Anything?”

# HUDSON: “There’s something.”

# HUDSON: “It’s inside the complex.”

# VASQUEZ: “You’re just reading me.”

# HUDSON: “No. No! It ain’t you. They’re inside. Inside the perimeter. They’re in here.”

### SITUATION OVERVIEW
Cinder Squad returned to Evergreen under rapidly deteriorating conditions. Patience, the colony’s NHP overseer, had become unstable—blocking communications, refusing aid to civilians, and issuing lockdown orders. Meanwhile, Beggar One’s Machine forces advanced from the south in overwhelming numbers, razing the Gray Towns and scattering any remaining militia resistance.

As the sky darkened with ash and electromagnetic interference, a critical refugee crisis unfolded at Evergreen’s gates. With Patience refusing entry and the Militia divided, the squad made the call to let the refugees in. It saved thousands—but fractured Evergreen’s chain of command beyond repair.

In the wake of this rebellion, Beggar One revealed himself on a system-wide broadcast. An orbital weapon struck the northern mountains, annihilating the subterranean city of Daylight and triggering powerful quakes that left Evergreen without power or cohesion.

Still, Cinder Squad launched a last-ditch assault on the Governor’s Farm—now the Machine’s stronghold. They fought alongside loyal militia, Rangers, and defectors to kill Beggar One and free Evergreen. But they were ultimately overwhelmed. Captured and thrown into a makeshift prison, the remaining pilots must now plan their next move from behind enemy lines.

### MISSION OBJECTIVES
- Prevent collapse of Evergreen’s defenses. (FAILED)

- Aid the refugees outside Evergreen in any way possible. (SUCCESS)

- Monitor and assess Beggar One’s tactical behavior and deployment. (SUCCESS)

- Attempt to kill or disable Beggar One. (FAILED)

- Free imprisoned allies. (IN PROGRESS)

### CRITICAL TASKS
## > MERRICKTOWN EVACUATION
Cinder Squad encountered the aftermath of a massacre—subalterns had razed the settlement. Survivors were rescued under fire. Subalterns demonstrated full override behavior under foreign control.

## › REFUGEE STANDOFF
At Evergreen’s gates, the pilots chose to open the colony to the refugees, overriding Patience’s lockdown. Though this action saved lives, it sparked civil unrest and a fracture in command. Contingency White was activated as peacekeepers—then turned hostile.

## › FINAL TRANSMISSION
Patience issued one final broadcast—cryptic, evasive, and marked by distortion. Moments later, Beggar One’s orbital strike vaporized a northern peak, erasing the hidden city of Daylight and triggering citywide blackouts. Evergreen was plunged into chaos.

## › FINAL TRANSMISSION
Alongside Brava Hadura and loyalist forces, the pilots assaulted the Governor’s Farm. They clashed with Contingency White, killing Eddie, Mauler, and Emma, while Anne Laurent escaped capture. Psalm was freed by Outlaw, and Patience was destroyed by Vet. Ultimately, the squad was overrun and captured.

› PRISONER’S DILEMMA
Held in the Depot District, now a prison camp for Evergreen’s citizens, the squad begins plotting their next move. Vanisher identified a maintenance tunnel for escape. Vet planted explosives for a future distraction, though they must be triggered manually—Tyrell volunteers to make the sacrifice. Outlaw learned that Beggar One is attempting to forcibly access the Omninode using citizen credentials, and may be preparing something far worse with an ancient NHP casket brought into the complex.

### RESULTS & NOTES
- Merricktown and Liu Maize destroyed.

- Refugee influx destabilized Evergreen and ignited civil conflict.

- Patience is confirmed dead.

- Beggar One commands a fully autonomous army and has orbital strike capability.

- Contingency White has been decimated; remaining members demand extraction.

- Cinder Squad is captured but actively organizing resistance from within.

- Evergreen is under complete Machine occupation.

### MISSION STATUS
MISSION FAILED — Evergreen has fallen.

However, the mission continues in a new form. Sabotage, extraction, and the exposure of Beggar One’s true goal remain possible. The war for Evergreen is lost, but the war for Hercynia is not over.

### STAKES
Beggar One’s access to the Omninode must be stopped. If successful, he will gain access to the Omninet. His forces are growing smarter, faster, and more coordinated, the threshold for Machine singularity may be near. Landmark’s last foothold in the hemisphere is gone. The only thing left is revenge, escape, or annihilation.
