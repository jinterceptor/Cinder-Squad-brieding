### SITUATION OVERVIEW
After a lull in direct hostilities, Evergreen came under sudden and coordinated assault from the Hercynian United Cities Rangers. What appeared to be a frontal push against the walls was, in truth, a tactical diversion—designed to mask a more catastrophic strike on the heart of the colony’s infrastructure.

While Patience remained partially cycled and vulnerable, Cinder Squad responded as a single cohesive force, identifying and disrupting the true objective of the attack: the Stable Reactor that supports both Evergreen’s shield grid and the casket housing Patience-1.

### MISSION OBJECTIVES
Repel enemy incursion at Evergreen’s outer defenses.

Intercept attempts to sabotage the Stable Reactor’s key nodes.

Prevent the Machine unit REGRET from reaching Patience’s casket in the Governor’s Farm.

### CRITICAL TASKS
› REACTOR NODE INTERCEPT

Cinder Squad maneuvered through urban combat zones to intercept HUC forces already inside the reactor complex. The first of two key nodes was lost before they arrived, but their rapid advance prevented further destruction and preserved enough power for continued defense operations.

## › REGRET CONFRONTATION

The Machine designated REGRET infiltrated Evergreen through an eastern breach. Cinder Squad intercepted it on the approach to the Governor’s Farm. Despite its overwhelming firepower and unknown systems, the squad successfully neutralized the unit just short of its target.

### RESULTS & NOTES

One reactor node lost; secondary systems rerouted to stabilize the grid.

REGRET neutralized and remains offline under containment.

Evergreen’s civilians were not evacuated but suffered minimal casualties.

Intelligence suggests REGRET was neither directly aligned with nor controlled by the Rangers.

### MISSION REWARD

All pilots advanced to License Level 2 (LL2).

Cinder Squad’s actions stabilized morale and averted colony collapse.

Evergreen authorities granted pilots enhanced access and logistical support.

### STAKES

The assault was a calculated attempt to cripple Union presence on Hercynia. Failure to stop both the Ranger saboteurs and the Machine unit would have likely resulted in a full collapse of Evergreen’s NHP network and strategic viability. Success preserved Union command continuity and bought precious time.

### PILOT DOWNTIME

## Vanisher
› Repaired Faulty Shielding module.

With expert research through Evergreen’s archives and salvaged Omninet fragments, Vanisher successfully completed repairs. The module will return to full function next cycle.

## Smokey
› Interrogated Psalm, the captured Ranger.

Smokey learned the Machine designated REGRET acted alone, without oversight from greater HUC forces. Patience issued a formal reprimand and alerted Smokey’s Union handler.

## Abraham 13
› Hacked Patience's black box and found traces of an outside influence.

Fragments reveal Patience is reacting to a recursive signal—origin unknown. A backup contingency has been initiated at a location marked “Quiet Night.” Abraham took 2 stress and is being watched more closely by Patience itself.

## Huntsman
› Studied Hercynian wildlife with his hummingmoth companion, Dutch.

Returned with key data on ecological shifts, but was tracked by a Ranger during the expedition—suggesting continued surveillance or intent to intimidate.

## Vet
› Organized the Evergreen Watch into a more coherent defense force.

Oversaw repairs to captured HUC mechs, and developed a VR training sim to onboard new pilots. Owes a favor to Castor Fielding for technical support.

## Ferryman

› Gathered restricted Union communications data.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
HUC forces have since withdrawn and signaled potential openness to peace talks.

The Machine threat has escalated with the appearance of REGRET. Its origin and link to the anomalous signal remain unclear.

Multiple parties now believe the conflict on Hercynia is no longer human in scope.
