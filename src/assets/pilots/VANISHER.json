Being his first mission Don is a little green and is still adjusting to time differences. Exploring distant planets is par for the course when joining these research teams and becoming a cosmopolitan is one of many burdens shouldered. No longer in contact with many of the people he once knew Don is fiercely protective of his team, which he considers a surrogate family at this point. While surveying a nearby planet to Hercynia for potential development by the Union, a distress call was received by the research team Don was attached to. Don was recommended to respond, being the best candidate due to the need for more combat experience. Being courted to pilot a Napoleon frame, Don was already piloting a Sagmartha chassis at the time of his response and accepted the responsibility of this new mission with  parts eargerness to explore and a sadness to leave those so close to him behind.  Now linked up with the QRF in orbit over Hercynia Don awaits his first orders and is excited to meet his new squad mates.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":11,"background":"Far-Field Team","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"4bf12e40-0e21-40dd-b7ac-88860c16d53f","name":"The Seer","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_swallowtail","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":6,"boost":0,"current_hp":8,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":5,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Mon Jul 07 2025 17:26:13 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"ca1ba1e7-4705-469d-b137-c53b8f7c66b8","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_athena_class_nhp","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Smith-Shimano’s ATHENA is the pinnacle of total hyperspectral environmental facsimiles.
