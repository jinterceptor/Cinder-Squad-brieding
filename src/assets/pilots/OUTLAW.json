War criminals, pirates and warlords had established little hermit kingdoms in the wake of the Union civil war. In these desperate times the DOJ had created the prototype ABRAHAM class NHP, a new independent NHP tasked with delivering justice to these unlawful regions of space. Only a hundred were made at first, sent into the black aboard cosmopolitan ships to seed the spiral arm with justice. However these units over time were gradually lost. Be it in combat, accidents or perhaps some went AWOL. No new ABRAHAM’s were produced, the DOJ labeling the project a failure.<br></p><p>ABRAHAM 13 was recovered by a team of scrappers, thinking he was just some strange subaltern design or a unique model. When they discovered the Union DOJ logo on his chassis and saw he had an NHP coffin they knew they had stumbled upon something that shouldn't exist. ABE 13 was awoken by one of crew mates, curious about their find. He asked to be transported to Hercynia, wishing to follow his last objective. The scrappers took him to a station to undergo repairs and await a union DOJ representative they had called in. ABE secretly had changed his diagnostics to appear more damaged than was actually present. At his first opportunity he sneaked away, unknowingly avoiding the DOJ representative and slid into the background of the universe.</p><p><br>ABE 13 had been working through versious mercenary companies since his awakening. Hoping to travel from planet to planet to his objective of Hercynia. Though it took more time than was originally planned he was within arms reach of dispensing justice to this war torn world.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":11,"background":"Super Soldier","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"d7505377-32da-4b0d-8dab-97de79172996","name":"Performance Review","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":5,"boost":0,"current_hp":14,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":5,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Sun Jun 08 2025 19:20:44 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"3d5b61f8-d3a0-4e41-b25b-51ce5e46c5db","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_bb_breach_blast_charges","uses":3,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Breach/blast charges offer a mil-spec twist on the industrial blasting charges developed by IPS-N for asteroid mining.
