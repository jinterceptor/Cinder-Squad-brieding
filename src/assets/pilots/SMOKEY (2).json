Nestled in the Outer Systems, it was <strong>self-sufficient, fiercely independent, and deeply suspicious of outside governance</strong>. The government fostered a strong sense of <strong>nationalism, resilience, and self-reliance</strong>, teaching its people that Union’s promises of progress were just a mask for control.</p><p>For centuries, Varkana had stood alone. And its people were proud of that.</p><p>When Union finally made contact, there was no war. No orbital bombardment. No occupation. Varkana’s leadership—after decades of maintaining sovereignty—<strong>chose to join peacefully</strong>. They cited long-term sustainability, technological advancements, and interstellar trade. To many, it was a <strong>new beginning</strong>.</p><p>To others, it was <strong>a betrayal</strong>.</p><p>Winona was among those who <strong>refused to accept</strong> that their leaders had simply “changed their minds.” To him, to his community, <strong>something didn’t add up</strong>. Had Union bribed them? Threatened them? Replaced them? No true Varkanan would surrender like this.</p><p>These fears drove him into the arms of the <strong>Free Varkana Movement</strong>, a militant faction that saw itself as a last line of defense against Union’s influence. They believed that if they struck hard enough—if they made the cost of occupation too high—<strong>they could force their world to reclaim its independence</strong>.</p><p>And so, Winona became a fighter.</p><p>He believed in the cause. Believed in the men and women fighting alongside him. <strong>They weren’t terrorists—they were patriots.</strong></p><p>Until the day he proved himself wrong.</p><hr><p><strong>The Bombing</strong></p><p>The plan was simple: <strong>detonate an explosive at a government complex suspected of coordinating with Union officials</strong>. It was meant to send a message. It was meant to shake Varkana’s leadership, to show them that the people had not surrendered.</p><p>It was <strong>never</strong> supposed to kill civilians.</p><p>Winona had convinced himself of that—right up until the moment he pressed the detonator.</p><p>The explosion tore through the building, collapsing walls and igniting the sky with fire and debris. At first, he felt nothing but <strong>cold satisfaction</strong>. But then came the screams. The smoke cleared just enough for him to see the <strong>bodies</strong>—government workers, Union diplomats, civilians who had no part in this war.</p><p>And children.</p><p>He had told himself there would be <strong>no innocents</strong> in that building. That it was a military target. But the truth had never mattered. He had <strong>never checked</strong>. He had let his hatred, his certainty, <strong>blind him</strong>.</p><p>Then, the second explosion hit—his own charge, detonating too soon.</p><p>He was caught in the blast.</p><p>Shrapnel tore through his flesh, <strong>ripping away his jaw, his nose, his limbs</strong>. The heat burned deep into his muscles, searing through nerves, <strong>reducing him to a broken, ruined husk</strong>. He collapsed onto the scorched earth, choking on blood and ash, drowning in the sounds of dying men and women.</p><p>And as he <strong>lay there, gasping for breath, dying among the very people he had killed</strong>—he realized the truth.</p><p><strong>Varkana’s leaders had never been coerced.</strong></p><p><strong>They had chosen peace.</strong></p><p><strong>And he had just murdered his own people for nothing.</strong></p><p>The pain was unbearable. The <strong>horror of what he had done was worse.</strong></p><p>He welcomed death. He <strong>wanted it</strong>.</p><p>But it never came.</p><hr><p><strong>Rebuilt by the Enemy</strong></p><p>Winona <strong>woke up in a Union hospital</strong>.</p><p>He shouldn’t have survived. Most of his body was <strong>gone</strong>, his flesh charred beyond repair, his limbs reduced to <strong>ragged, bloodied stumps</strong>. And yet—<strong>Union had saved him</strong>.</p><p>Even knowing who he was.</p><p>Even knowing what he had done.</p><p>They could have left him there. Let him rot. Let him become a cautionary tale. But instead, <strong>they chose mercy</strong>.</p><p>And that? <strong>That broke him more than any explosion ever could.</strong></p><p>Everything he had believed—<strong>the lies, the fear, the hatred</strong>—crumbled beneath the weight of his own actions. <strong>He had been the villain.</strong></p><p>And Union? The so-called enemy?</p><p><strong>They had been the ones to save him.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Atonement</strong></p><p>Rebuilding him wasn’t easy. His body was shattered beyond natural repair. To restore him, <strong>Union partnered with Harrison Armory</strong>, providing him with <strong>state-of-the-art cybernetic enhancements</strong>.</p><p>The transition was… unsettling. His new body was stronger, faster, more durable than before—but it wasn’t his. <strong>His reflection was unrecognizable.</strong> His cybernetics were so advanced, so integrated, that <strong>even he struggled to tell where the machine ended and the man began.</strong></p><p>But that didn’t matter. Because he had made a choice.</p><p>Winona <strong>renounced the Free Varkana Movement</strong>. He dedicated himself <strong>fully to Union</strong>, not out of obligation, but out of <strong>a desperate need to atone</strong>.</p><p>For the past <strong>thirty years</strong>, he has served as a <strong>Lancer</strong>, fighting for Union with <strong>a grin on his face and a weight in his soul</strong>.</p><p>To those who meet him, Winona is <strong>chipper, upbeat, always quick with a joke</strong>. He carries himself with an easy charm, an almost unsettling <strong>lightness, even in the face of war</strong>.</p><p>But it’s not because he doesn’t care.</p><p>It’s because <strong>he has to</strong>.</p><p>Because if he ever stops smiling, if he ever lets himself <strong>dwell on the past</strong>—on the people he killed, on the screams he left behind—he might never crawl out of that darkness again.</p><hr><p><strong>The Family He Doesn’t Deserve</strong></p><p>At some point, against all odds, <strong>Winona found love</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dr. Helena Orlan-Friesz</strong>, the <strong>Union field surgeon</strong> who had helped save him, saw something in him—<strong>something worth saving</strong>. She was sharp, pragmatic, and had no patience for his nonsense, which made her the perfect counterbalance to his <strong>chipper, self-deprecating attitude</strong>.</p><p>Over time, what began as mutual understanding turned into something deeper.</p><p>Together, they built <strong>a life</strong>.</p><p>They had a son, <strong>Elias \"Eli\" Friesz</strong>, now sixteen. Eli is smart, quick-witted, and <strong>too perceptive for his own good</strong>. He <strong>sees the cracks in his father’s armor</strong>, the pain Winona refuses to talk about. And unlike his father, <strong>Eli isn’t convinced that Union is perfect</strong>.</p><p>He asks <strong>hard questions</strong>, the kind that make Winona’s cybernetic fingers twitch.</p><p><strong>\"Dad, do you ever wonder if you’re just following orders again?\"</strong></p><p>Winona doesn’t have an answer for that.</p><p>Because if he lets himself <strong>question Union</strong>, if he allows even the slightest doubt to creep in—<strong>then he has to ask himself if he was wrong again</strong>.</p><p>And that? That terrifies him.</p><p>So he keeps moving forward. Keeps <strong>fighting, smiling, following orders</strong>.</p><p>Because that’s what he <strong>owes the dead</strong>.</p><p>And if Union needs him to do something grim, something awful, something others won’t?</p><p><strong>He’ll do it.</strong></p><p>Because Union saved him.</p><p>Because <strong>he will never let himself be that man again</strong>.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":10,"background":"Super Soldier","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"45375f0b-8527-4329-8bca-00908116d55c","name":"Lucky You","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":17,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":6,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Wed Apr 02 2025 23:10:13 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"b8cd1aa2-c9b7-41bb-968d-9a646e567796","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_pattern_b_hex_charges","uses":3,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_pattern_a_smoke_charges","uses":3,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_explosive_vents","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"With the right tweaks, it becomes possible to dump excess heat into the area directly surrounding a chassis.
