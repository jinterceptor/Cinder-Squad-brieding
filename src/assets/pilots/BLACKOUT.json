During a routine patrol, the Henotic was struck by an unidentified paracausal weapon, triggering a sudden and horrific cascade in all onboard NHPs. The resulting systemic collapse caused the vessel to be forcibly drawn into slipspace under uncontrolled conditions. The ship was lost with all hands, save for a single escape pod recovered several weeks later. Aboard were one survivor, the ship’s EWAR officer, and a severely fragmented instance of the Henotic’s E-WAR NHP, inhabiting the pod’s emergency systems. The method of survival remains unknown. Following debriefing and incident review, Blackout was reassigned to surface operations and paired permanently with the surviving NHP fragment, now named Pharos. After completing advanced training in systems warfare and tactical support for mechanized units, Blackout was elevated to full Lancer status under exceptional-conditions clearance.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":9,"background":"Hacker","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"b86a8dbf-d85a-45e0-91eb-3dd36b456b8b","name":"Eidolon","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_chomolungma","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":12,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":4,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Wed Sep 17 2025 17:35:20 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"905c27d7-ed64-47b5-b346-f99766098f1a","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_technophile_1","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"<span class='horus--subtle'>[an eager student].</span><br>Gained from the <i>Technophile: Rank I</i> pilot talent."},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_custom_paint_job","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_manipulators","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Precise interaction with built and natural environments, soft targets, and hazardous materials is part of the daily routine for support-class mechs.
