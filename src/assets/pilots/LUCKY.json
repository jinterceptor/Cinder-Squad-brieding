He grew up on a dustball colony where the biggest dreams were getting off-world and the biggest fears were debt collectors showing up before payday. When the bills piled higher than his father’s drinking and his mother’s stubborn pride, Buddy signed on with the only outfit hiring without asking too many questions: the Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company.<br><br>MSMC wasn’t glamorous. They weren’t elite shock troops or precision operators; they were the galaxy’s garbage men. The poor bastards sent into the meat grinder when everyone else refused the job. Buddy learned quickly that the company valued contracts more than lives, and that survival depended on two things: your squad and your own stubborn will. He wasn’t the fastest, smartest, or deadliest merc in his unit, but he endured. He carried heavy packs until his back ached, patched frames with duct tape and curses, and marched into fire because it was his only way forward.<br><br>His scar came from one of those jobs that MSMC is infamous for. A suppression contract on a mining world teetering on revolt. The brass sold it as routine, “low resistance, low risk.” In truth, the locals had been stockpiling weapons for years, and Buddy’s squad walked straight into a killing field. His squad leads frame was gutted in the first barrage, the canopy torn open like a tin can. Shrapnel cut across his scalp scarring him. For hours he lay trapped beneath the wreckage.<br><br>When he finally came to, the battle was over. His squad was dead. Retrieval crews had written the site off as a total loss, and Buddy would’ve been just another unclaimed body if not for sheer coincidence; a Union patrol passing through picked up his fading lifesigns. They dragged him out of the mud, half-dead but breathing.<br><br>He earned the callsign “Lucky.” At first, it was a joke. Surviving a massacre wasn’t luck, it was just bad timing that left him behind. But the name stuck. Buddy kept surviving when others didn’t. Shuttle crashes, ambushes, collapsing habs. Every time he should’ve died, he walked away with another scar, another story, and fewer friends. To his comrades, it made him charmed. To Buddy, it was just cruel chance, the universe refusing to let him off the hook.<br><br>When his term finally ended, Buddy didn’t re-up. Union was recruiting veterans with licenses and field experience, and he took the first offer out. Compared to MSMC, Union training was a vacation: real food, real med care, and commanders who actually gave a damn whether you lived to see the next drop. Buddy adapted, but he never shed the edge Mirrorsmoke had carved into him. Where others talk about ideals and duty, he sees casualty numbers and operational risks. Where others dream of glory, he dreams of getting through a mission without anyone left behind.<br><br>Now Union has him on assignment to Cressidium, his first official deployment as a Lancer pilot. The mission is straightforward on paper. Bodyguard detail. Buddy doesn’t complain. He’ll keep his charge breathing, because that’s the job. But deep down, he knows better than to trust a clean briefing. He’s \"Lucky\" Stiltner, after all. And luck, in his experience, always comes with a cost.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":9,"background":"Ex-MSMC Mercenary","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"c8b6972a-6850-4c74-88ff-16ad3cb1baa6","name":"Here For Now","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_sagarmatha","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":10,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":4,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Thu Sep 18 2025 10:52:16 GMT+0100 (Irish Standard Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"https://d1nurxym97qk9o.cloudfront.net/public/us-east-1:88c19765-1cef-c39c-b5da-4d456e8923d4/mech/Here_for_now_New_animation.gif","loadouts":[{"id":"f5e6c31f-4a20-4078-aa86-afee3dfbc2e6","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_expanded_compartment","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_armament_redundancy","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"By installing additional armor plating, redundant firing circuits, and enhanced insulation to magazines the longevity of a frame’s armaments can be greatly enhanced."},{"id":"ms_custom_paint_job","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_turret_drones","uses":3,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"The use of turret drones is a rather traditional form of force multiplication – one that has remained the backbone of defense in many theaters."}],"integratedSystems":[],"mounts":[{"mount_type":"Main","lock":true,"slots":[{"size":"Main","weapon":null}],"extra":[],"bonus_effects":[],"modifiable":true},{"mount_type":"Flex","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Flex","weapon":{"id":"mw_thermal_pistol","destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"loaded":true,"mod":null,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions.
