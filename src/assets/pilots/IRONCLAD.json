For centuries, House Virek has served the House of Stone faithfully, renowned for their fierce commitment to duty, discipline, and tradition. Yet their prestige has long been shadowed by a humiliation suffered generations ago during the infamous <strong>Sanjak Revolution</strong>.</p><p>During that historic conflict nearly four hundred years ago, Cassian’s ancestor, Admiral Lucian Virek, was tasked with crushing the rebellion on the moon Sanjak. Though initially successful, Lucian was blindsided when insurgents revealed advanced military technologies supplied clandestinely by sympathetic Republican scientists from the <strong>House of Water</strong> on Umara. Lucian’s fleet was shattered, marking a devastating defeat for House Virek. The event resulted in disgrace, stripping House Virek of much of its former prestige—humiliation that has lingered unresolved through generations.</p><p>This ancestral shame has shaped Cassian’s upbringing profoundly. Since childhood, he has been taught that restoring the honor of House Virek is his life’s purpose. His father, Lord Regent Aldric Virek, ensured that Cassian grew up fully aware of their family’s damaged reputation, filling him with stories of past glories and the treachery of Umara’s Republican scientists. Cassian’s older sister, Alessa, was raised similarly, but tragically died young in an unrelated training accident—a loss that only increased the pressure on Cassian to become the family’s redeemer.</p><p>Over the generations, House Virek has quietly but persistently attempted to rebuild its standing, serving loyally in key military roles, and taking every opportunity to oppose the Republicans at every turn. But the shadow of their humiliation during the Sanjak Revolution continues to hang heavy—especially because the descendants of the Umara scientists responsible for Admiral Lucian’s defeat still flourish, celebrated openly as heroes and intellectual leaders among Republicans.</p><p>When Cassian learned that a direct descendant of that same House of Water scientist had risen to fame in Umara for revolutionary military innovations—earning praise among the Baronies' reformists—he felt the weight of centuries upon his shoulders. Determined to finally confront this ancient humiliation and restore the honor lost generations ago, Cassian committed himself fully to becoming an elite pilot worthy of his lineage’s ambitions.</p><p>Leveraging House Virek’s still-considerable political connections, Cassian secured entry into the prestigious <strong>Karrakin Cavalry College</strong>, pledging himself to master the deadly and efficient IPS-N Caliban chassis. Before leaving, his father handed Cassian a blade passed down from Admiral Lucian himself—an heirloom symbolizing their long-delayed quest for redemption. Cassian swore a solemn vow upon that blade that he would finally erase the family’s disgrace.</p><p>What Cassian could not yet know was that the very descendant of his family's nemesis, the renowned Umaran scientist now famed for their revolutionary designs, would also be attending the Cavalry College—setting the stage for an explosive clash of honour, ideals, and family legacies that has simmered for centuries.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":7,"background":"Noble","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"d0acdb68-bd9c-49a5-8921-e8a75899823e","name":"Regent’s Pride","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":15,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":5,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Sat Jul 12 2025 22:08:32 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"https://d1nurxym97qk9o.cloudfront.net/public/us-east-1:88c19765-1cc5-c46a-4a38-b661a10a4a9c/mech/Regent's Pride.png","loadouts":[{"id":"7864b4a8-9c40-40b7-9467-23c38d293d9c","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_armament_redundancy","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"By installing additional armor plating, redundant firing circuits, and enhanced insulation to magazines the longevity of a frame’s armaments can be greatly enhanced."},{"id":"ms_stable_structure","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_rapid_burst_jump_jet_system","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""}],"integratedSystems":[],"mounts":[{"mount_type":"Main","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Main","weapon":{"id":"mw_shotgun","destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"loaded":true,"mod":{"id":"wm_supermassive_mod","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false},"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions.
