While living a life of luxury he was always bored and often would throw items at and boss the staff around needlessly. During adolescence he snuck out of his families estate at the same time as a renown lancer was passing through the city where his family held their station and saw the adoration and fame the lancer garnered. This inspired young Vladimir to go down the route to become a lancer. However this caused his father Vladimir Predes the fifth to disown him. Even so he still carries influence over lesser people or so he thinks. <br><br>Before his disowning he managed to use his family name to get into a officers academy and while at first disappointed with not being put on track to be a lancer he was soon found to be a natural at piloting mechs causing him to be selected to become a lancer. It was at this time without his knowledge was disowned. The callsign \"Charming\" was assigned to him by a instructor who found himself saying the word sarcastically almost each time Vladimir opened his mouth and thus became stuck with the name. The most notable attribute of the man was his reaction speed and innate understanding of ballistic calculations.<br><br>When dictating the design of his mech he asked for \"The biggest possible artillery feasible as is becoming of one of my standing\"   </p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":6,"background":"Noble","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"ece925ab-ed23-46df-abde-1328ed16e50b","name":"Independent Variable","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":12,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":5,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Tue Aug 13 2024 18:00:15 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"0a5ee2aa-2f8f-426b-9be3-d2a4f70fdceb","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_armament_redundancy","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"By installing additional armor plating, redundant firing circuits, and enhanced insulation to magazines the longevity of a frame’s armaments can be greatly enhanced."},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_pattern_a_smoke_charges","uses":3,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_rapid_burst_jump_jet_system","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""}],"integratedSystems":[{"id":"ms_walking_armory_1","uses":6,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Gained from the <i>Walking Armory: Rank I</i> pilot talent."}],"mounts":[{"mount_type":"Main","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Main","weapon":{"id":"mw_mortar","destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"loaded":true,"mod":null,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions.
