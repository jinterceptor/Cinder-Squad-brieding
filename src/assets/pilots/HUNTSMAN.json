On Ishara-7, hunters who are able to track and eliminate the deadliest creatures from the planet's vast jungles and deserts are celebrated as <strong>heroes</strong>. Raised in this world, Jonas spent his youth immersed in the wilderness, learning from the great hunters who had come before him. The creatures of Ishara-7 are unlike any others—alien beasts with unique abilities and adaptive strategies. The most prestigious hunters are those who can take down these threats and return with proof of their kill.</p><p>By the time Jonas was in his early twenties, he had already earned his place among the planet's <strong>elite hunters</strong>. His reputation was built on his <strong>uncanny ability to track</strong> even the most elusive alien creatures. His father, a former soldier turned legendary hunter, taught him everything he knew. However, it was a mission that would change his life forever—an alien creature, far beyond anything he had ever encountered, ambushed his team in the dense jungle. His comrades were lost, and Jonas barely escaped with his life. The guilt of failing to protect his team haunted him, and it was then that he left the prestigious world of hunting behind.</p><p>Feeling the need to redeem himself, Jonas abandoned his old life and became a <strong>mercenary</strong>, offering his skills to the highest bidder. He quickly gained a reputation for being the best at what he did—tracking and eliminating threats, whether they were alien creatures or human enemies. Still, the honor of hunting never fully left him. Though now a mercenary, he still carried the memories of his home world and the honor of his past.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":8,"background":"Mercenary","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"a773c809-543a-43db-abb6-314c025c4324","name":"Feldgheist","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_mourning_cloak","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":5,"boost":0,"current_hp":12,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":3,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Sun Jun 29 2025 21:36:23 GMT+0200 (Mitteleuropäische Sommerzeit)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"78cd572c-73ec-44c0-8fae-3600fe8a3b0f","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_hunter_logic_suite","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Built from interpreted strands of DHIYED paracode, SSC’s Hunter Logic is an agile computational memetic: a dual synthetic/VLS-vector systemic weapon capable of interfering with both a target’s computer and its crew."},{"id":"ms_singularity_motivator","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"This unique gravitic power plant was first developed by SSC’s Exotic Materials Group for the first-generation Mourning Cloak.

The cloak enhances this effect by extruding a semiorganic membrane that wraps around the mech to provide an additional layer of protection.<br>At present, the long-term effects of affinity amplification on organic matter are unknown; before receiving clearance to operate a FADE cloak, pilots must agree to check in with their SSC personal concierge on a regular schedule.
