He learned early that survival came down to a quick tongue and quicker hands. After years running odd jobs — smuggling, debt collection, escort duty — Cassian found his true calling in the cockpit of a mech. Unlike many pilots who prefer long-range safety, he thrives in the chaos of close combat, carving through steel and armor with the same confidence he uses to charm a crowded bar.</p><p>Though a mercenary by trade, Cassian isn’t the kind to take contracts that leave common folk bleeding for corporate profit. He’s built a reputation as a charming rogue — willing to bend the rules, play dirty, and cut deals in back alleys, but just as likely to slip a few credits to the locals when the dust settles. For some, he’s trouble incarnate; for others, a folk hero who fights with a smile and a knife hidden up his sleeve.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":6,"background":"Mercenary","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"74e45015-5299-463e-b664-56ce1182031b","name":"Gloom","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":10,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":5,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Wed Sep 17 2025 22:37:01 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"d3d9d270-e40d-4b20-90a2-8ca453da8442","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_rapid_burst_jump_jet_system","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_eva_module","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_custom_paint_job","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""}],"integratedSystems":[],"mounts":[{"mount_type":"Main","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Main","weapon":{"id":"mw_assault_rifle","destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"loaded":true,"mod":null,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions.
