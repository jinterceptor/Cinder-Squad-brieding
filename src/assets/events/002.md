## FIELD INTELLIGENCE REPORT

# SUBJECT: HUC Rangers – Status, Composition, and Behavior

# CLASSIFICATION: Level-B Clearance – Active Colonial Security Threat (De-escalating)

# ISSUED BY: Liaison Haruki Oda, Union Command

# DATE: Post-Mission 01 Debrief

## OVERVIEW

The HUC Rangers (believed to be remnants of the defunct Harrison-Ursinus Colonial entity) have shifted their stance from active hostility to cautious non-engagement. While Union does not formally recognize their legitimacy, intelligence gathered by Cinder Squad indicates that the HUC Rangers have ceased all open aggression toward Evergreen and its militia.

According to the latest report, Cinder Squad was first contacted by a commander of the Ranger's, while no definitive peace was confirmed, they did state an intention to stop hostilities and discuss things further.

## KNOWN ELEMENTS AND TACTICS

Sniper Detachments: Initial engagement included a long-range precision unit capable of navigating Hercynian terrain with lethal effectiveness. Utilized cloaking tech and elevation for maximum disruption. Pilot-casualty risk considered high in open terrain.

Strike Lances: Coordinated mech teams attacking simultaneously across different fronts. Demonstrated efficient mech-to-mech combat tactics, with fallback contingency patterns.

Command Structure: While no commanding officer has been visually confirmed, behavior suggests unit cohesion, orders, and fallback doctrines are being issued from a central authority. Enemy comms are encrypted using pre-Crash era cipher protocols, suggesting long-standing isolation or deliberate obfuscation.

Communication Protocols: Captured comms logs indicate references to “Rangers,” “Colonial Asset Defense,” and “Priority Site Authorization.” These are remnants of early colonial expansion-era parlance.

## POSSIBLE OBJECTIVES

Union analysts propose the following hypotheses:

Territorial Reclamation: The HUC Rangers may believe Hercynia remains a rightful corporate claim or strategic asset. Their presence and actions suggest an intent to secure territory and critical infrastructure.

Legacy Directive: It is possible that these forces are operating under standing orders issued decades—or centuries—ago and have not been rescinded. This would explain the rigid behavior and obsolete tactical references.

Automated or Indoctrinated Doctrine: It remains possible some or all HUC personnel have undergone long-term indoctrination or have been raised in isolation, believing themselves to still be under lawful orders. Alternatively, some command-level functions may be partially automated.

## REVISED THREAT LEVEL

Downgraded from Tier 1 Persistent Threat to Tier 2 Strategic Uncertainty.

While their recent behavior suggests a move toward negotiation, motive and reliability remain unknown. Historical indicators point to long-term ideological indoctrination and isolation from Union reality, which may complicate dialogue.
