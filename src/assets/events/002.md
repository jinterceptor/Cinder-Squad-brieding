# FIELD INTELLIGENCE REPORT

SUBJECT: HUC Rangers – Status, Composition, and Behavior

CLASSIFICATION: Level-B Clearance – Active Colonial Security Threat

ISSUED BY: Liaison Haruki Oda, Union Command

DATE: Post-Mission 01 Debrief

OVERVIEW

The so-called “HUC Rangers” (designation inferred from uniform markings and encrypted transmissions) appear to be a paramilitary remnant of a defunct or blacklisted entity: Harrison-Ursinus Colonial (HUC). No active license exists for HUC within Union’s current corporate registry, and the last confirmed activity of the entity dates to pre-SecComm collapse. Current operating status: rogue.

Pilots first encountered these forces during the defense of Evergreen’s infrastructure and outlying settlements. Hostile engagements have confirmed that the HUC Rangers are highly organized, tactically competent, and operating with militarized discipline. They are not simple raiders—several units display formal mech training and operate in coordinated strike formations with a clear command structure.

KNOWN ELEMENTS AND TACTICS

Sniper Detachments: Initial engagement included a long-range precision unit capable of navigating Hercynian terrain with lethal effectiveness. Utilized cloaking tech and elevation for maximum disruption. Pilot-casualty risk considered high in open terrain.

Strike Lances: Coordinated mech teams attacking simultaneously across different fronts. Demonstrated efficient mech-to-mech combat tactics, with fallback contingency patterns.

Command Structure: While no commanding officer has been visually confirmed, behavior suggests unit cohesion, orders, and fallback doctrines are being issued from a central authority. Enemy comms are encrypted using pre-Crash era cipher protocols, suggesting long-standing isolation or deliberate obfuscation.

Communication Protocols: Captured comms logs indicate references to “Rangers,” “Colonial Asset Defense,” and “Priority Site Authorization.” These are remnants of early colonial expansion-era parlance.

POSSIBLE OBJECTIVES

Union analysts propose the following hypotheses:

Territorial Reclamation: The HUC Rangers may believe Hercynia remains a rightful corporate claim or strategic asset. Their presence and actions suggest an intent to secure territory and critical infrastructure.

Legacy Directive: It is possible that these forces are operating under standing orders issued decades—or centuries—ago and have not been rescinded. This would explain the rigid behavior and obsolete tactical references.

Automated or Indoctrinated Doctrine: It remains possible some or all HUC personnel have undergone long-term indoctrination or have been raised in isolation, believing themselves to still be under lawful orders. Alternatively, some command-level functions may be partially automated.

THREAT LEVEL

The HUC Rangers are a Tier 1 Persistent Threat to Evergreen and Union operations on Hercynia. Their tactical discipline, refusal to respond to hails, and willingness to engage in lethal force place them beyond the profile of typical raider cells. They are not open to negotiation at this time.
