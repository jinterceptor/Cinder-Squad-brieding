# SUBJECT: Landmark Colonial Crisis Response Team “Contingency White”
# CALLSIGN: CRT-WHITE
# CLASSIFICATION: Tier-1 Colonial Rapid Response Asset
# ISSUED BY: Haruki Oda, Union Liaison Officer
# REVISION DATE: [Post-Roadblock]

## OVERVIEW

Contingency White is a Crisis Response Team deployed by Landmark Colonial, one of the Hercynia development stakeholders and Evergreen’s principal funding body. Their arrival was not preceded by notice or standard Union authorization, but the team has since presented official clearance and operational independence under Landmark's emergency jurisdiction clause.

This team is authorized to conduct recovery, stabilization, and strategic asset protection operations in the event of corporate-level collapse or colony destabilization. Though technically not under Union command, their Ident-codes and contracts supersede local authority unless explicitly revoked.

They are not here to protect Evergreen—their mission is asset recovery and damage assessment. By Landmark’s metrics, Evergreen may already be considered compromised.

## COMPOSITION

Contingency White is composed of experienced personnel from varied military and private security backgrounds, supported by an in-field NHP.

COMMANDING OFFICER:

EDDIE WU (He/Him)

Formerly of Mirrorsmoke. A contract-weary veteran on his final deployment. While he sees the Hercynia assignment as a low-threat “milkrun,” he remains a competent and organized leader. No known ideological conflicts.

EXECUTIVE NCO:

ROY “MAULER” KAUL (He/Him)

Ex-Harrison Armory Legionnaire, transferred after disciplinary action during a deployment on DS8. Brash, cybernetically enhanced, and highly aggressive in direct engagement. Known to favor hand-to-hand conflict, maintains a confrontational attitude toward standard command etiquette.

MEDICAL OFFICER:

BALSAM SINGH (He/Him)

A blink-run veteran with Cosmopolitan roots. Near retirement and seeking permanent residency. Calm, experienced, and likely to act as the squad’s emotional center. A practicing Sikh.

SECURITY OFFICER:

EMMA BROADSTREET (She/Her)

New to CRT deployment, previously served in a Landmark colonial defense force. Reliable, earnest, and motivated by a desire to earn full citizenship and clear her family’s corporate debt. Maintains high regard for discipline and chain of command.

NHP TECHNICIAN & SECURITY OFFICER:

ANNE LAURENT (She/Her)

Landmark lifer and Contingency White’s handler of the NHP “Connie.” Calm, composed, and fiercely protective of her assigned subalterns and NHP. Appears to harbor deep fascination with artificial intelligence, with some ideological leanings toward NHP autonomy.

## ASSOCIATED NHP: “CONNIE”

Exact designation unknown. Connie operates under a strict cycling schedule overseen by Anne Laurent. The NHP is used for both coordination of CRT subalterns and on-field tactical computation. No signs of cascade have been reported. Other team members actively avoid direct contact with it.

## KNOWN DEPLOYMENT HISTORY

While most CRT deployments are confidential, informal chatter suggests Contingency White has been involved in:

Suppression of an outbreak in a Landmark resource colony on Themis Beta

Salvage and shutdown of an abandoned blink gate stabilization zone in the Peregrine Drift

Escort and recovery operation during a pirate siege on Tharsis Line Four

## CURRENT MISSION PROFILE ON HERCYNIA
- Objective: Assess threat level and viability of Evergreen and surrounding infrastructure
- Secondary: Secure key personnel, data cores, and colonial assets for Landmark retrieval
- Status: Operational. Have established secure channels and made contact with Union-aligned assets

While the CRT has thus far acted with professionalism, they are not subordinate to Union forces. They have the authority to overrule Evergreen command in situations deemed a threat to Landmark property or investment. Their priority remains asset protection and extraction, not civilian defense.
