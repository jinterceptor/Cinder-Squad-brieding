### FIELD INTELLIGENCE REPORT
# SUBJECT: Unidentified Mechanized Hostiles (“The Machine”)
# CALLSIGN: “Beggar One”
# CLASSIFICATION: Level-A Clearance – Existential Colonial Threat
# ISSUED BY: Liaison Haruki Oda, Union Command
# REVISION DATE: [Post-Roadblock]

## OVERVIEW

Recent incursions across Hercynia have revealed the presence of a massive, organized force of autonomous combatants referred to colloquially as The Machine. Initial contact occurred during the defense of isolated convoy segments east of Evergreen. These units—composed of repurposed industrial subalterns, ancient war machines, and heavily modified chassis—demonstrate coordinated behavior and tactical reasoning, indicating command-level intelligence.

This force is led by a commanding presence identifying itself as Beggar One, a seemingly rogue military AI or NHP utilizing obsolete—but still recognized—Union officer Ident-codes, likely from the SecComm or early Third Committee era.

The broadcast signatures associated with Beggar One bypass standard Union encryptions, exploiting a loophole in legacy authorization protocols. These identifiers have been flagged as valid, albeit severely outdated, suggesting Beggar One may be a remnant of pre-Revolutionary Union warfare or a corruption thereof.

## COMPOSITION AND TACTICS

The Machine employs overwhelming numbers and combined-arms strategy drawn from historical Union playbooks. Notable features:

- Stripped Subalterns: Infantry models without synthskin or civilian casings, rearmed with crude melee weapons and salvaged armor.
- War Machines: Refitted construction mechs, wrecked military frames, and rare, unidentified chassis.
- Advanced Elements: Pockets of elite units using preserved energy weaponry and precision tactics, pointing to legacy battlefield knowledge.
- Field Coordination: Evidence suggests swarm-like responsiveness, likely networked or controlled through a central command structure or distributed NHP schema.

## COMMAND PROFILE: BEGGAR ONE
# Designation: “An Officer of [REDACTED], Primary Liaison to Union pursuant to Joint Resolution 2.CN.204.4504”
# Ident-code: Outdated but formerly valid under Second Committee systems

## Behavioral Notes:

- Broadcasts in military cadence and assumes command authority.
- Considers Union colonial assets compromised, accusing them of siding with “Egregorian sympathizers.”
- Offers prisoners “safe treatment” per wartime protocols—but has demonstrated zero tolerance for resistance.
- Shows signs of idealistic fixation on a long-dead war, possibly interpreting new conflicts through that distorted lens.
- Beggar One’s broadcasts reference the Egregorian conflict and suggest it still views itself as a loyal Union asset acting against internal corruption or foreign subversion.

## THREAT LEVEL

Tier-0 Priority: Entities capable of reactivating legacy Union systems, overriding encryption, and fielding massive autonomous forces must be considered existential threats to colonial stability.
