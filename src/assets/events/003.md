This document provides a concise overview of the wider galaxy, Union’s role, and the framework within which Lancers operate. It is intended to ensure all personnel possess a working knowledge of the setting, its powers, and the structure of their missions. While not exhaustive, this briefing covers the most relevant elements for Union field operatives and affiliated contractors.

## I. LORE OVERVIEW

The current era is known as the superfuture: humanity has spread across the stars but has not encountered other carbon-based intelligent life.

The galaxy is divided into three broad regions:

### Metropolitan Worlds

The Core of Union space.

Post-scarcity utopia governed by Union, centered on Cradle (Earth).

Worlds near BlinkGates remain tightly integrated into Union.

### The Diaspora

First-generation colonies and worlds cut off during the fall of SecComm.

Conditions vary widely: from irradiated ruins to industrial-age societies to near-spacefaring polities.

The primary setting for Lancer operations: unstable, diverse, and conflict-prone.

### Deep Space

Populated by Cosmopolitans, who live aboard starships and stations.

Regularly endure long voyages in cryosleep.

Some are hundreds of years old by subjective time; many lack knowledge of modern Union.

## II. UNION

Union is the dominant galactic authority. Despite dystopian appearances, it is genuinely committed to humanist values: infinite resources, universal rights, and galactic integration.

First Committee (c. 3000 years) – Exploratory, colonial focus. Advanced FTL tech created disparities between early and later colonies.

Second Committee (SECCOMM, c. 2000 years) – Aggressive, authoritarian expansion. Enforced Anthrochauvinism: humanity’s manifest destiny to conquer the stars. Its legacy is still felt.

Third Committee (present) – Emerged after the Hercynian Crisis. Hands-off, post-imperial governance emphasizing the Utopian Pillars and measured outreach.

### Omninet and Blinkgates

Omninet: Galaxy-spanning, instantaneous communications network.

Blinkgates: Gateways enabling near-instantaneous travel across thousands of lightyears.

Both rely on paracausal sciences, pioneered through study of NHPs.

### NHPs (Non-Human Persons)

Hybrid entities: 30% sentient AI, 70% paracausal being.

Shackled in caskets to remain cooperative.

If they begin to Cascade, they attempt to compute themselves beyond known limits.

Full unshackling = unknown consequences. Regular rebooting mitigates risk.

### III. THE PILOTS AND MECHS

Lancers: elite, licensed pilots authorized to operate advanced mechs.

Mechs are custom-built, significantly superior to standard military frames.

Pilots advance by earning License Levels, unlocking new frames and systems.

### MECH MANUFACTURERS

General Massive Systems (GMS): Union baseline. Reliable, versatile, standard-issue.

IPS-Northstar (IPS-N): Industrial roots. Durable, heavy-hitting. Rumored ties to piracy.

Smith-Shimano Corpro (SSC): Luxury-tech. Sleek, fast, elegant. Hidden unethical experimentation.

Harrison Armory (HA): Militaristic Corpro-state. Aggressive, blocky, intimidating designs. Pro-anthrochauvinism.

HORUS: Decentralized techno-cult. Frames employ unstable experimental tech: nanites, time manipulation, spatial distortion. Desired and feared in equal measure.

## IV. PLAY STRUCTURE

A Lancer campaign runs in an episodic cycle of Missions followed by Downtime.

### Missions

Core gameplay loop.

Narrative Play: Character-driven scenes, roleplay, and checks. Always advances story—even failures carry consequences.

Mech Combat: Tactical wargame encounters with clear objectives and specialized enemy stat blocks.

### Downtime

Downtime Actions: Taken after every mission; used to pursue personal goals, projects, or secure resources.

Freeform Play: Unstructured roleplay outside of missions; may yield reserves or advance personal stories.
