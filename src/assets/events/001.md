UNION INTERNAL DOSSIER – FIELD DEPLOYMENT REFERENCE // DO NOT DISTRIBUTE OUTSIDE UNION OPERATIVES

Approved by: PATIENCE-1

Compiled by: Liaison Haruki Oda, Hercynia Crisis Response

OVERVIEW:

This document serves as a primer for Union-affiliated operatives deployed to Evergreen Colony, located on Solo Terra, Hercynia. The following material summarizes critical logistical data, prominent individuals, and geographic zones of strategic importance.

Evergreen is the last standing colony on Hercynia following the failure of multiple Landmark Colonial initiatives. Originally designed as an agricultural hub and expansion site, it has been transformed by necessity into a vulnerable but vital foothold for continued Union interest on the planet.

INFRASTRUCTURE PROFILE:

Population: ~1,300 individuals (pre-incident estimates)

Governing AI: PATIENCE-1 (Union-licensed, sub-sapient)

Supply Lines: Severed orbital access; low-orbit drops via compromised Landing Bowl

Power Grid: Incomplete. Primary generation supplied via refurbished Landmark solar and geothermal stations.

# STRATEGIC LOCATIONS:

GOVERNOR’S FARM:

Repurposed command center housing Evergreen's administrative core and PATIENCE-1's local architecture. Acts as the colony’s communication hub and high-level decision node.

LANDING BOWL:

Large impact-cleared basin originally built for heavy landers. Damaged during recent raids. Repair is essential for continued resupply and rapid evacuation scenarios.

# PRIMARY CONTACTS:

PATIENCE-1 – Evergreen’s Operational AI

Designed to be helpful, friendly, and polite. Maintains control over colony logistics and sensor arrays. Frequently downplays severity of current threats.

Chief Engineer Castor Fielding – Infrastructure Lead

Direct, pragmatic, and often frustrated. Oversees all colony utilities. Cooperates with pilot units when it aligns with Evergreen’s survival. Offers material rewards for performance.

Dr. Eku Marricado – Historian and Analyst

Former Landmark xenoarchaeologist, now Evergreen’s archivist. Source of compiled data on the planet’s pre-Union history and the extinct (allegedly) Egregorians. Wary of PATIENCE. Known to encourage independent study.

Brava Hadura – Local Militia Commander

A veteran of small-colony defense operations, Brava Hadura is the acting commander of the Evergreen militia. Originally a member of the colonial administration’s security detail, she stepped into command after Evergreen’s previous military overseer succumbed to illness shortly after settlement. Despite the overwhelming odds and poor equipment, she’s done her best to hold the line.

# ADDITIONAL NOTES:

CIVILIAN MORALE:

Low, but stable.

AUTOMATED UNITS:

Evergreen subalterns are few and aging. Most labor functions have reverted to manual operation. No combat subalterns remain active, though a few were seen scavenging debris sites without orders.

# UNKNOWN VARIABLES:

Prior colonial failures have left abandoned facilities across the region.

Some homesteaders report strange signals or sightings — dismissed as trauma-induced.

Patience has refused all requests to disclose classified sections of its own operating records. Reason: “Union Oversight Pending.”
