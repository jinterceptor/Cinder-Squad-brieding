## I. VESSEL OVERVIEW

- Class: Ebro-class Light Carrier

- Role: Escort carrier, patrol and support operations

- Era: Introduced during late Second Expansion; revitalized under Third Committee reorganization

## Capabilities:

- Fields wings of fighters, bombers, and mounted chassis (mechs with external naval-operation packs).

- Acts as force multiplier in contested zones.

- Proven effective against pirates and hostile subline-equivalent Diasporan fleets.

The Rio Grande is smaller than full carriers (e.g. the Amazon-class) but is fast, flexible, and capable of independent action for extended periods.

## II. CURRENT DEPLOYMENT

- Station: Orbit over Cressidium.

- Mission: Provide secure transport, logistics, and overwatch for Union’s diplomatic delegation.

### Operations:

- Transport of trade goods, cultural exchanges, scientific and engineering detachments.

- Orbital overwatch and protection of Union envoys.

- Regular shuttle runs to and from Cressidium’s surface.

Cressidium’s native powers present limited naval threat capacity at present; Rio Grande maintains high alert but low combat expectation.

## III. LIFE ABOARD

### Standard Operations

During deep-space patrols, crews rotate between:

- Stasis (“downtime”) – Long-term hibernation for efficiency.

- Active Shifts (“uptime”) – Duty rotations for maintenance and watchstanding.

Currently, with all hands active in support of the mission, life aboard includes:

- Regular maintenance, drills, training, and readiness briefings.

- Close coordination with diplomatic and scientific teams.

### Crew Culture

With no pressing combat threat, daily life also includes:

- Recreational traditions: card games, chess, and Kapkat (a popular Diasporan import).

- Media access: curated omninet broadcasts and cultural exchanges.

- Physical activity: sparring practice, fitness regimens.

- Simulation competition: pilot cadre competing for high scores on mech/fighter simulators.

Morale aboard the Rio Grande remains stable, aided by the ship’s strong traditions of camaraderie and competition.

## IV. PLAYER ORIENTATION: TIMELINE TO SOLSTICE RAIN

The squad has been in transit for six months aboard the Rio Grande. During this period, pilots and personnel have engaged in:

- Drills and tactical training to remain combat-ready.

- Simulator exercises, building camaraderie and rivalry alike.

- Cultural exchange prep, with envoys and scientists preparing presentations for Cressidium.

- Routine shipboard duties, from maintenance rotations to assisting logistics crews.

- Downtime recreation, including games, sparring, and quiet study.

This long voyage has given the squad time to bond, sharpen skills, and prepare for their mission. Now, with the diplomatic operation in full swing, Rio Grande stands as both fortress and lifeline in orbit above Cressidium.
